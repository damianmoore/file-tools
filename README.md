Misc tools for keeping file systems clean and tidy

 * check_dir_contains_files - Goes though all files in one directory and checks they exist in another. Checks files match in size and checksum.
 * photo_organiser - Moves image files from one directory to a destination based on a directory structure in the form of year/month/day. Dates are read from EXIF data.
 * check_valid_images - Reads all images in a directory and shows if any could not be decoded.
 * du_log - Stores disk usage of the file system over time. It's designed to be run once a day (but can be run less frequently or irregularly) and makes a compressed file for each day.
 * du_compare - Used to compare two log files generated by du_log. It shows which directories grew or shrunk the most over the period, ordered with the biggest increasing directory at the top.
